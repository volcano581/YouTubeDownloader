# YouTubeDownloader
This is a python program to download YouTube videos at highest available resoultion

I have added a Gui version of youtube downloader which provides user with a clean interface for providing link and destination path for downnloaded videos

This repo is open for public contribution to enhance GUI for selection of resolution from available resolutions. For this purpose a dropdwon list should be added containing all resolution of the desired video.
Upon selection of a particular resolution, video should be downloaded for that resolution only.
